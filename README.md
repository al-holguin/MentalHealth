# MentalHealth
There is a mental health crisis going on. We can stand around and hope it gets better, or we can do something. This is what I am doing.

Action starts in your house. How is mental health dealt with within your own home?

Open, honest discussions
Logical, less emotional, non-judgmental responses

Keys to positive mental health:
  Nutrition
  Sleep
  Relationships
  Mindfulness
  Physical Activity
